Computational analysis of gut microbiome and SCFA (acetate, butyrate, propionate) time series data

# Folder (need to be cleaned)
our_data: original and processed data generated by this project
literature_data: published data in the literature (human gut microbiota responses under inulin intervention)
codes: each folder correspondes to one main text figure and its associated supplementary figures
figures: AI-editable figures created for the manuscript
references: relevant papers


To run the codes, the following third-party packages/databases are required
1. Cmdstan (https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan) for inulin responder detection in Fig.4
2. seqNMF (https://github.com/ContextLab/seqnmf) for factor analysis in Fig.3
